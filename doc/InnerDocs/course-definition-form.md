# Course Definition Forms


According to the [Course Structure](course-structure.md), each Course will be assigned a *Unique ID* based on **Identification**, **Content**, and **Implementation** details. These three tables represent different aspects of each course under the NAIC project. Please use the “[Course Definition Form](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1peXF74GnOtcX3-bXIWZ_ZwPPtuPwqTCGFnuPVxGJNdc/edit?usp=sharing)” template to propose courses. You may also refer to [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1isWDgkntkiP_HgodEEj40tcWA3iushRK7-k4v5W6noA/edit?usp=sharing) as a guideline for creating your own documents.
