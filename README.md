# Welcome to the Norwegian AI Cloud ☁️ Training & Creating the Knowledge Hub Git Repo!

Every contributor can upload their own recommendations and work under this repository (with appropriate commit messages 🤓).

## What is going on here 🧐

This repo is created to bring together the work of all contributors under a single roof and to track all developments from one place. We use:

### 1. GitHub Pages 📄 
Serves websites from a GitHub repository. 

-  We are on this [GitHub Page](https://naicno.github.io/Training_KnowledgeHub/) 💻

### 2. GitHub Actions 🧮
Automatically runs code when this repository changes.

-  When a change occurs in this repo, ```sphinx-build``` runs automatically and makes the result available to the Github Pages. Just refresh it! 
  
## What happened to gitlab 🤔

All work package related issues and follow up tasks still continue on gitlab.sigma2 ✌️

*Stay educated and continue to educate!*  
*Have fun :)*
